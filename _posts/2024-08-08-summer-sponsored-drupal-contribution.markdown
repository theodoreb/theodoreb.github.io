Much like my [last update] [sponsored] things are going well. I am able to spend 2 full days every week on contribution
and my commit activity has increased quite a lot. Many thanks to my sponsors: [Palantir.net] [palantir], [OPTASY] [optasy], 
and new ones who joined in the past few weeks: [Vardot] [vardot], [OpenSense Labs] [osl], and [Liip.ch] [liip].  

Now some numbers, since the last update I committed 82 issues (worth 820 weighted issue credits), that's about 33 issues 
per month (or 330 issue credits). That's a few more issues per week than before. There is still room to increase the
commit activity with more sponsors so don't hesitate to check out how to [sponsor my contribution] [contrib1] in core.
