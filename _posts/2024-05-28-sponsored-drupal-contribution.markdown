Back in March I started to look at sponsors for the time I'm spending working on the Drupal core issue queue. It's 
been a few months and I wanted to go back on all the sponsored commits I made as a Frontend Framework Manager, to 
show how the sponsorships helped Drupal for the past few months. 

The [sponsorship offer] [contrib1] is simple: you send me a fixed monthly fee of 2500â‚¬, and I share the issue credit
of every Drupal core commit that I make. I'm very thankful to [Palantir.net] [palantir] and [OPTASY] [optasy]
who are sponsoring me. Thanks to them I was able to increase the amount of commits I can make to Drupal core. In the 
last 3 months I committed 61 issues (worth 610 weighted issue credits) and the more sponsors I have, 
the more time I can spend reviewing and committing issues.

Many of these issues are maintenance focused, it's not shiny, it's not exciting, and it needs to be done. 
Sponsoring big initiatives like Starshot is exciting, let's not forget the unexciting day to day that keeps things 
running. If you're interested in supporting my work on Drupal core and keep the frontend fixes coming, 
consider [sponsoring me] [contrib2].
